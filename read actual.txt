Let‚Äôs expand your legal documents AI solution with multi-agent + dashboard features so that it is not just a single-output tool, but a multi-purpose, high-value system.

üîπ Problem Statement (India context)

People and small businesses deal with complex legal documents (rental agreements, land papers, contracts, loan papers).

Hard to understand hidden clauses, fraud risks, and obligations.

Verification against govt. rules or compliance is missing.

Even educated urban users struggle, and rural users often sign without understanding terms.

üîπ Multi-Agent AI Solution (Legal Doc Assistant)
1. Document Understanding Agent

Input: Upload legal doc (PDF, scanned image, Word).

Task: Extract text, tables, signatures, and structured data using OCR + NLP.

Output: A clean, structured representation (clauses, parties, dates, obligations).

2. Clause Risk Analyzer Agent

Input: Structured doc from above.

Task: Detect suspicious/unfair terms (hidden fees, penalties, ownership transfer).

Output: Color-coded highlights (‚ö†Ô∏è High risk, üü° Medium, ‚úÖ Safe).

3. Compliance & Verification Agent

Input: Extracted doc + govt. rules database (land laws, tenancy acts, RERA, etc.).

Task: Compare document terms against Indian legal standards.

Output: A checklist: ‚ÄúClause 4 violates tenancy law ‚Äì rent hike above 10% not valid.‚Äù

4. Summarizer + Translator Agent

Input: Original doc.

Task: Create plain language summary in multiple Indian languages.

Output: ‚ÄúThis agreement means: You are renting for 11 months. Rent increase 5% yearly. Deposit ‚Çπ50,000 refundable.‚Äù

5. Recommendation & Next-Step Agent

Input: Risk + compliance output.

Task: Suggest next actions ‚Äì e.g.,

‚ÄúAsk landlord to remove Clause 7.‚Äù

‚ÄúConsult lawyer for ownership check.‚Äù

‚ÄúRegister agreement at sub-registrar office.‚Äù

Output: Step-by-step guidance.

6. Dashboard & Analytics Layer (for Users & Shops)

For Individuals:

Upload docs ‚Üí Get risks, summary, next steps in a clean dashboard.

For Law Firms / Small Legal Kiosks:

Multiple clients ‚Üí Track cases, flagged risks, generate reports.

Extra Features:

Trend analysis (e.g., ‚ÄúMost rental docs in Chennai contain unfair rent hike clauses‚Äù).

Document history (compare old vs. new agreements).

üîπ Example Real Use Cases in India

Urban Rental Agreements ‚Äì Detect illegal rent hike, missing registration.

Rural Land Sale Deeds ‚Äì Catch fraudulent land ownership transfers.

Loan Agreements with MFIs ‚Äì Identify hidden fees, unfair penalties.

Gold Loan / Pawn Shop Docs ‚Äì Spot predatory interest rates.

Small Business Vendor Contracts ‚Äì Highlight auto-renewal, monopoly clauses.

üîπ Tech Stack (Multi-Agent + Google AI)

OCR & Extraction ‚Üí Google Document AI + Vision API.

LLM for Clause Analysis ‚Üí Gemini / PaLM 2 (via Vertex AI).

Knowledge Base ‚Üí Govt. legal rule DB + custom RAG pipeline.

Multi-Agent Orchestration ‚Üí LangChain Agents or Google Agent Builder.

Dashboard ‚Üí Streamlit / Firebase / Google AppSheet.

‚úÖ This makes your solution multi-output, multi-agent, community-focused.
Instead of just saying ‚ÄúClause risky‚Äù, it gives: Extract ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Summarize ‚Üí Recommend ‚Üí Dashboard view.

üëâ Would you like me to design a sample dashboard layout (like what users will see step by step: Upload ‚Üí Risks ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Actions)? That will make this feel like a real working app flow.

Nice ‚Äî you want a full, practical design for a multi-agent Legal Documents platform focused on Small Business Vendor Contracts with rich features: multilingual conversion, live law updates & notifications, date-aware verification, policy comparison, document authenticity detection, unique-region IDs, add/remove laws, sharing/approval flows, dashboard and a global AI chatbot that ties everything together. Below is an end-to-end solution: architecture, agents, data flows, UI screens, tech mapping to Google products, implementation plan (MVP ‚Üí advanced), security/privacy notes, sample data schemas, and example agent prompts.

1 ‚Äî One-line vision

A multi-agent Legal Document Assistant that ingests vendor contracts, auto-extracts & simplifies clauses, compares them to up-to-date laws/policies (date-aware), detects probable fraud/AI generation, supports multilingual output & user-chosen verification date, and notifies users of law changes ‚Äî all via a dashboard + conversational AI.

2 ‚Äî Key capabilities (what the system must do)

Ingest PDFs/images/Word & parse into structured clauses.

Extract clause types (auto-renewal, exclusivity/monopoly, auto-charge, termination, indemnity).

Compare clauses vs selected laws/policies (date-bound): show applicability and exact policy lines.

Allow user to choose ‚Äúverify as of‚Äù date (contract creation date vs today) ‚Äî verification results change accordingly.

Continuously keep law/policy DB up to date (auto ingestion & timestamped). Send toast/ticker alerts when relevant rules change.

Multilingual: default English + produce translations into producer/consumer languages on demand (mandatory for that agreement if required).

Document authenticity check: detect AI-generated text signs, suspicious edits, metadata mismatch, signature verification (where possible).

Unique regional ID generator for agreements.

UI: dashboard with left policy pane (select laws/policies), main doc view with clause highlights, compare view, timeline/history, notifications ticker, PDF/download/QR/approval flows.

Global chatbot that can answer holistic queries and drive users to specific clauses or laws.

3 ‚Äî Multi-agent architecture (high level)

We implement separate agents (ADK agents) that A2A coordinate via MCP / PubSub. Each agent is a microservice:

Ingest Agent

Function: accept files (PDF, image, DOCX), extract metadata, create document record, store raw file.

Outputs: raw text, OCRed pages, file metadata.

Document Understanding Agent

Function: Document AI (OCR), clause boundary detection, table extraction, signature region extraction, parties/dates extraction.

Outputs: structured clause objects: {clause_id, clause_type, text, page_no, start_offset, end_offset}.

Clause Classifier Agent

Function: classify clauses into categories (auto-renewal, exclusivity, price adjustment, jurisdiction, arbitration, termination, confidentiality, indemnity).

Outputs: clause labels + confidence.

Simplification & Translation Agent

Function: simplify clause text to plain language; translate into selected languages (producer/consumer languages). Stores both simplified & translated text.

Outputs: {simplified_text, translations: {hi, bn, ta, ...}}.

Policy Retriever Agent (RAG)

Function: retrieve relevant laws/policy texts (national, state, international) relevant to clause text using embeddings + BigQuery index; records policy versions and effective dates.

Outputs: matching policy snippets + policy metadata (title, effective_date, source_url, pdf).

Date-Aware Verifier Agent

Function: given a user-selected verification date (e.g., contract_date or today), compare clause against the policy snapshot valid at that date; compute applicability, conformity or conflict, and list exact policy lines that match.

Outputs: verification status per clause {applicable: true|false, conflict: true|false, matched_policy_lines: [...]}.

Law Updater Agent

Function: periodically scrapes / ingests official law sources, notifications feeds, gazette updates, major legal portals and stores versioned laws in DB; publishes change events.

Outputs: new policy versions, diffs, change_meta.

Change-Notification Agent

Function: consumes policy change events, evaluates if any existing user docs are impacted (based on domain, region, clause types) and pushes toast/ticker alerts; proposes actions; requests user confirmation for re-verification.

Outputs: banners, toast push messages, email/phone notifications.

Authenticity Agent

Function: detect probable AI generation (statistical/textual signals), detect suspicious edits, check document metadata (PDF creation, mod time), digital signature verification (if present), watermark/signature image matching.

Outputs: authenticity score & red/green flag; evidence items.

Compare & Traceability Agent

Function: allow user to pick one or more policies and run a focused comparison; produce mapping of doc clauses ‚Üí policy lines and a traceability report (for standards like ISO).

Outputs: mapping table and exportable compliance proof.

UniqueID Agent

Function: generate structured region-aware unique doc IDs: <CC3><TYPE_CODE><REGION_CODE><6digit-serial> (e.g., 091TA880-000123); maintains registry and numbering rules by region/type.

Outputs: unique id, QR payload.

Approval & Sharing Agent

Function: handle approval workflows (multi-sign), phone/email OTP verification for sharing, generate signed PDF/QR, record audit trail.

Outputs: downloadable file, QR codes, approved flag.

Analytics Agent

Function: dashboards, trends (e.g., common risky clause occurrence), user activity, policy impact metrics; power left-hand policy list with drilldown.

Global Chat Agent (Gemini-based)

Function: holistic conversation ‚Äî answers user queries pulling context from document, clause verification outputs, policy texts, translations; can orchestrate rechecks, create tickets for lawyers, or start approval flows.

Interfaces with all other agents via A2A for real-time answers.

4 ‚Äî Data model (simplified)

Document:

doc_id, unique_id, owner_id, uploaded_at, doc_date, region, languages_required, file_url, extracted_text_url, authenticity_score, verification_history[]

Clause:

clause_id, document_id, type, text, simplified_text, translations{lang: text}, page, offsets, classifier_confidence, verified_results[]

Policy:

policy_id, title, jurisdiction, effective_from, effective_to, source_url, pdf_url, full_text, version_id, topics[]

VerificationResult:

verification_id, document_id, clause_id, policy_id, verification_date, status, matched_lines[], evidence[], created_at

Notification:

notif_id, user_id, doc_id, message, type, severity, shown, created_at

5 ‚Äî UI / UX (screens & flows)
A. Top nav + left side persistent policy pane

Left: Policies & Laws Tree (searchable, filter by jurisdiction, add/remove policy references). Clicking a policy opens original source (pdf) plus ‚ÄúSimplified‚Äù overlay.

B. Main Document Workspace

Top bar: Document title, Unique ID, Upload date, Region tag, ‚ÄúVerify as of‚Äù date selector (dropdown: Document date / Custom / Today).

Main: PDF viewer with clause highlights (color-coded: Red = high risk, Yellow = medium, Green = ok).

Right panel: clause detail for selected clause:

Original clause text, simplified text, translations (tabs), matched policy snippets with links and exact lines, verification status, authenticity badge.

Buttons: ‚ÄúRequest lawyer review‚Äù, ‚ÄúStart approval‚Äù, ‚ÄúCreate draft revision‚Äù, ‚ÄúMark resolved‚Äù.

C. Compare View

Left: chosen policy (show exact lines). Right: document clause list with tick marks showing matched lines. Bottom: ‚ÄúAI confirm mapping‚Äù button which triggers the Global Chat Agent to produce a declaration like: ‚ÄúClause 4.2 maps to GST Section X (effective YYYY-MM-DD) as follows‚Ä¶‚Äù (and can be exported).

D. Notifications / News ticker

Top or bottom ticker banner: live alerts for policies affecting user documents. Toasts for urgent changes. Click opens ‚Äúwhat changed‚Äù modal showing diffs and affected documents.

E. Dashboard (Law Firms / Admin)

Cards: Recent uploads, Documents at risk, Pending approvals, Policy changes this week.

Charts: Clause type frequency, regional risk heatmap.

F. Document Share & Approval

Generate share link + QR; require OTP verification by recipient; record signature/approval; produce final signed PDF.

6 ‚Äî Date-aware verification & law versioning (how it works)

Policy versioning: every policy entry has effective_from and effective_to (null if current). Law Updater Agent stores versions and diffs.

User selects verification date: Date-Aware Verifier Agent queries the policy DB for the version valid at that date.

Verification logic:

For each clause, run semantic matching (embeddings: clause ‚Üî policy lines) with thresholds and alignment scoring.

If policy.effective_from <= verification_date < policy.effective_to or policy.effective_to is null, it‚Äôs considered for comparison.

Result: shows verified_as_of_date and differences to "current law". UI also offers ‚ÄúRe-verify as of today‚Äù to see new conflicts.

7 ‚Äî Law updates, toast & ticker mechanism

Law Updater Agent polls / webhooks official sources and legal feeds (e.g., Ministry gazettes, RBI, CBDT, GST portal) and updates policy DB.

On update, Change-Notification Agent runs a targeted evaluation: it finds documents that reference the policy jurisdiction or clause types and computes an impact score.

If impact > threshold, it pushes:

Ticker banner on dashboard

Toast push on mobile/email/SMS

In-app modal requiring user to confirm whether they want to re-verify their docs

Each notification includes: what changed, when it takes effect, and ‚ÄúVerify as of‚Äù quick buttons.

8 ‚Äî Document authenticity detection

Metadata checks: PDF creation/modification metadata mismatch between claimed creation date and metadata.

Signature checks: If digital signatures present, use public key verification (if available). For image signatures, compare to signed sample (if user uploaded).

AI-generated check: run stylometric detectors + LLM-based detectors producing a probability of synthetic generation (not foolproof).

Watermark/forgery checks: image analysis on scanned documents to find pasted blocks / layered edits.

Output: authenticity_score with supporting evidence (metadata, suspicious segments, signature validation result).

Important: be explicit in UI ‚Äî only ‚Äúprobable‚Äù detection; always offer human review escalation.

9 ‚Äî Unique ID scheme

You requested region/type prefix logic. Proposed format:

<CCC><TYP><REG><SERIAL> where:

CCC = ISO numeric country code (India = 091) ‚Äî up to 3 digits.

TYP = 2-letter document type (TA = Trade Agreement, VA = Vendor Agreement, SA = Service Agreement, ND = NDA, PO = Purchase Order).

REG = region code 2‚Äì4 chars (state or destination country ISO numeric e.g., Bangladesh 050 but you can also use 3-digit region code 880 as in your example).

SERIAL = zero-padded 6-digit counter per (CCC, TYP, REG) (e.g., 000123).

Example: 091TA880-000123 (India Trade Agreement for Bangladesh prefix 880 serial 000123). Stored in UniqueID agent registry. QR payload includes doc_id, checksum, created_at.

10 ‚Äî Add/Remove policy references (user control)

Policy Pane includes an ‚ÄúAdd Policy‚Äù button:

Upload a PDF or provide source URL. Law Updater Agent ingests it, assigns metadata (jurisdiction, effective date).

Policies can be toggled on/off for a document. The Date-Aware Verifier will only consider selected policies.

Admin roles: org admin can curate policy bundles (e.g., GST bundle, Labor Law bundle).

11 ‚Äî Sharing, Approval & Audit trail

Approval workflows with multi-sign steps.

Shareable signed PDF with embedded unique ID and QR.

OTP verification via phone/email before finalization.

Audit log stored in BigQuery / Firestore ‚Äî immutable (append-only) records.

12 ‚Äî RAG & traceability for standards (ISO/IEC)

For complex standards (ISO 9001, ISO 27001), maintain a requirements-to-test traceability matrix: policies parsed into atomic requirements; Clause mapping shows which requirement a clause addresses. Exportable as CSV for audits.

13 ‚Äî Tech mapping to Google stack (detailed)

Frontend: Firebase Hosting (React/Next.js) or Google App Engine hosting.

Auth: Firebase Auth (email/phone OTP) + Identity Platform for SSO.

File storage: Cloud Storage (versioned).

OCR & parsing: Vertex AI Document AI (for PDFs/scans) + Cloud Vision for images.

LLM & Conversational: Gemini via Agent Builder for chat and simplification. Use Vertex AI RAG (Embeddings + Vector DB in BigQuery or Vertex Matching Engine) for policy retrieval.

Agents / Orchestration: ADK agents deployed on Cloud Run / Vertex endpoints with MCP for A2A messaging; use Cloud Pub/Sub as event bus.

Policy DB & analytics: BigQuery for versioned law storage, diffs and analytics; Firestore for live app state (documents, clauses).

Auth/approval & OTP: Firebase Cloud Functions + Twilio or Firebase Extensions (SMS/email).

Monitoring & logging: Cloud Logging & Monitoring, with traceable logs for each agent action for audit.

Signature verification / cryptography: Cloud KMS for signing generated artifacts (QR payload signing).

CI/CD: Cloud Build + Cloud Deploy.

PDF generation: Cloud Functions with PDF libraries or Vertex AI to generate human-friendly summary PDFs.

14 ‚Äî Example agent prompt templates (short)

Clause Classifier (Gemini prompt skeleton)

You are a legal clause classifier. Input: "<clause text>". Output: JSON { "types": ["auto_renewal","jurisdiction"], "confidence": [0.92,0.75], "short_explanation": "..." }.


Simplification Agent

Simplify the following legal clause into plain, non-legal language suitable for a small business owner. Keep it concise (<= 40 words). Also produce a Hindi translation. Clause: "...."


Policy Retriever (RAG retrieval query)

Find policy paragraphs relevant to this clause: "<clause text>". Prioritize exact matches mentioning "renewal", "termination", "exclusive", "jurisdiction". Return up to 5 snippets with source_url and effective_date.


Date-Aware Verifier

Given clause and selected verification_date YYYY-MM-DD, compare clause to retrieved policy snippets valid at that date. Produce JSON: {status: "conflict|compliant|partial", reason: "...", matched_policy_lines: ["..."] }


Authenticity Agent

Analyze document metadata and text to detect likely forgery or AI-generation. Provide confidence score and list of suspicious indicators (e.g., metadata mismatch, stylometry anomalies, pasted blocks).

15 ‚Äî MVP (minimum viable product) ‚Äî recommended scope (4‚Äì8 weeks)

Focus on core flows to show value quickly:

MVP features

Upload PDF/DOCX ‚Üí Document Understanding Agent extracts text & clauses (Document AI).

Clause classification for top 5 clause types (auto-renewal, exclusivity, price adjustment, termination, confidentiality).

Simplification (English) + translations for 2 regional languages (e.g., Hindi, Bengali).

Policy retrieval for 1 jurisdiction (India) seeded with major laws (GST, Contract Act, Consumer Protection). Versioned policies.

Date-aware verification: user can choose doc date or today.

Dashboard with clause highlights + verification results.

Basic authenticity checks (metadata mismatch + simple AI-generation detector).

Unique ID generation and QR export + PDF summary download.

Global Chat Agent for Q&A limited to doc context & verification outputs.

Change notifications: manual trigger (Law Updater initial seed, no automated scraping in MVP).

This MVP already demonstrates the multi-agent flows, multilingual simplification, date-aware verification, uniqueness, and sharing.

16 ‚Äî Advanced features (post-MVP)

Full automated law ingestion & diffs (Law Updater with official gazette scraping & webhook ingestion).

Automated change impact scoring and proactive re-verification.

Support for more jurisdictions & international policy mapping.

Stronger authenticity checks (signature PKI integration).

Compliance traceability (ISO requirement mapping).

Integration with legal service providers for paid human review.

Marketplace for policy bundles and lawyer services.

17 ‚Äî Privacy, legal & risk notes

Do not provide legal advice; include clear disclaimers: ‚ÄúThis tool is informational, not a substitute for a qualified lawyer.‚Äù

Store minimal PII; obtain explicit consent for uploads/notifications.

For authenticity and signature verification, rely on standardized digital signatures where possible ‚Äî scanned signatures are weak evidence.

Keep audit logs for compliance; allow user to delete documents (but retain anonymized audit trail as required by law).

18 ‚Äî Implementation timeline & team (suggested)

Week 0‚Äì1: Project setup, GCP project, ADK scaffolding, Firebase app skeleton.

Week 2‚Äì4: Ingest + Document AI + Clause classification + Simplification (English).

Week 5‚Äì6: Policy DB seed + RAG + Date-aware verification + Unique ID.

Week 7‚Äì8: Chat Agent + Dashboard + PDF export + basic authenticity checks + sharing.

Week 9+: Polish, automated law ingestion, notifications, multi-lang translations, production hardening.

Team: 1 product owner, 1 backend engineer, 1 frontend engineer, 1 ML/LLM engineer, 1 QA/legal consultant.

19 ‚Äî Example user journey (demo script)

User uploads a Vendor Agreement (PDF). Doc gets unique id 091VA091-000012.

UI shows clause highlights; Clause 3 flagged as Auto-renewal (RED).

User selects ‚ÄúVerify as of contract date (2025-09-15)‚Äù. Verifier says Clause 3 conflicts with GST rule effective 2025-08-01 (policy lines shown).

User clicks ‚ÄúTranslate to Bengali‚Äù ‚Üí translation appears, and simplified Bengali text appears.

User clicks ‚ÄúCompare with Trade Policy‚Äù ‚Üí mapping table shows Clause 3 maps to Policy X lines 4.1‚Äì4.3 with links.

Authenticity Agent flags small risk (PDF metadata modified).

User clicks ‚ÄúShare for approval‚Äù ‚Üí selects recipient email, OTP verified, recipient signs; final signed PDF with QR generated.

20 ‚Äî Deliverables I can produce next (pick 1 or more)

a. Component-level architecture diagram and sequence diagrams for A2A flows.

b. Sample Firestore & BigQuery schema + example SQL to query policy versions.

c. Starter code templates: ADK agent template for Ingest Agent + Document AI invocation + simple classifier.

d. Demo UI wireframes (screens: upload, main doc view, policy pane, compare view).

‚îÇ additional language conversion based on the requirement in place where this business or its person involve in this business required, All diff laws should be auto updated to current ‚îÇ

‚îÇ date , along it some auto update about current news related to that document or law as going as Toast notifications (small popup alerts) , Live message banners or ticker-like sections ‚îÇ

‚îÇ because for example (some document related to Indian which is GST person may create document on 21st Sep then that rule while new GST rule will be followed by 22nd Sep onwards only so ‚îÇ

‚îÇ business agreement should not be confused and it should he should aware using live updates.) to avoid confusion ai need to get confirmation to user based on what date and law they ‚îÇ

‚îÇ needed, and it need to have all document or law rules should be auto collected when particular document which need to be cretaed or verifed by by our solution and then if it user ask to ‚îÇ

‚îÇ verfiy ceratin previous document it need to have option to choose verfiry based on today date or agreement or contract crretaed date and based on that it need to verfies and it need to ‚îÇ

‚îÇ answer along with that what are rules are updated or new rules cames in that it need to show to the user in separate option as how it looks it is need to be renewed with new rules and ‚îÇ

‚îÇ weather not it applicable to all current rules of that particular company it need to shows , along with that it need to verifies if uploaded document is original or ai generate as dummy ‚îÇ

‚îÇ it need to shows, along with that it need to shows as separate dashboard where it need to have separate left side screen where it shows as diff rules or agreement which consider for ‚îÇ

‚îÇ that document like Indian law for domain business, Indian law for company norms, Indian law for employee , foreign country or international polices, trade policy like(Support FDA, IEC ‚îÇ

‚îÇ 62304, ISO 9001, ISO 13485, and ISO 27001 standards with full requirement-to-test traceability.) all need to shows up , if user click on the any particular law it need open as law page ‚îÇ

‚îÇ original link, and its pdf and at button on that simplified llm answer as simplified version which need in overlay page. addtionally it need to have option us to compare it with only ‚îÇ

‚îÇ particular rules and regulations like indian trade policy with current document and it need to shows what are the points in the documnet is applicable to this laws/policy and at bottom ‚îÇ

‚îÇ it need to have button as ai chatbot llm which says it this document this points which has been verifed by this this line in the policy of trade exactly and clarifies this user his ‚îÇ

‚îÇ which gives holistic approach and which connects with all links and policy works answer users overall as app suggestions to the user along with asnwering query to the users questions. ‚îÇ

‚îÇ and it need to have option to upload reference document which means when employee 1 cretaed or having his dcoumnet which is created by either manual or with document based on that it ‚îÇ

‚îÇ need to understand and create also. but meanwhile it need to have option to verfiy weather it is sample document or fraud document it need to show red or green color popup and and it ‚îÇ

Agent-Avan ‚Äî Complete design & implementation plan (end-to-end)

Fantastic ‚Äî below is a complete, production-grade blueprint for Agent-Avan: a multi-agent Legal Documents platform focused on Small Business Vendor Contracts and covering everything you asked for: multilingual conversion, live law updates & notifications, date-aware verification, policy comparison, document authenticity detection, unique region IDs, add/remove laws, sharing/approval flows, dashboard, global chatbot, audit trail, and the multi-agent/A2A architecture using Google AI + cloud services.

I‚Äôll first explain how the architecture maps to your requirements, then give the agents, exact data flows, UI screens & UX flows, tech mapping to Google products, repo & deployment plan (Agent-Avan), sample schemas, example prompts, unique ID rules, authenticity checks, and MVP ‚Üí full production plan. Everything is designed to be real-time and actionable.

1 ‚Äî How this covers your full brief (summary)

Agent-Avan covers all requested features:

Multi-agent architecture (ADK agents + A2A via MCP / Pub/Sub) to modularize ingestion, classification, simplification, policy retrieval, date-aware verification, authenticity, notifications, approvals, translations, analytics and the global chatbot.

Multilingual: English default + mandatory producer/consumer language conversion; on upload the Simplification & Translation Agent creates required translations and stores them.

Date-aware verification: user chooses verification date (document date or any date). Date-Aware Verifier uses the policy snapshot valid on that date and returns compliance/conflict, plus diffs to current law.

Live law updates & notifications: Law Updater Agent ingests official sources, produces diffs; Change-Notification Agent computes impacts and pushes toast/ticker and inbox notifications; users can confirm re-verification as required.

Policy comparison & granular mapping: Compare mode & Traceability Agent maps specific clauses ‚Üî policy lines (including standards like ISO/FDA) with direct links & overlays.

Document authenticity detection: metadata check, signature verification where PKI available, stylometry/AI-generation scoring, scanned image forgery detection.

Unique region IDs: UniqueID Agent issues region/type codes and maintains counters; QR export includes signed payload.

Add/remove policy references: UI policy pane allows adding/removing policy references (user or org level); Date-Aware Verifier considers active policies only.

Approval & sharing flows: OTP verification for sign/approve, multi-sign workflows, PDF/QR generation with KMS signatures; audit trail stored.

Dashboard & progressive step UI: visual step progress per document (green/red), left policy pane, main clause viewer, compare overlay, translation tabs.

Global chatbot: context-aware Gemini agent that can orchestrate rechecks, run comparisons, and instruct other agents.

All steps visible & confirmable: interactive UX with step status, confirmations for irreversible actions, explicit warnings when user requests to remove mandated clauses.

3 ‚Äî Agents (detailed) ‚Äî responsibilities & A2A interactions

Each agent is an ADK microservice. Agents communicate via Pub/Sub with message schemas.

Ingest Agent

Input: file (PDF/JPG/DOCX), metadata (uploader, region, languages required).

Action: store file (Cloud Storage), emit doc.ready event with file reference.

Output: doc_id, raw_file_url, metadata.

Document Understanding Agent

Input: doc.ready.

Action: call Vertex Document AI & Vision, OCR, extract pages, signatures, tables; produce raw clause segmentation.

Output: structured clauses[] saved to Firestore and event doc.understood.

Clause Classifier Agent

Input: doc.understood.

Action: use Vertex custom classifier or Gemini prompt to label clause types (auto-renewal, exclusivity, price adjustments, termination, arbitration etc.). Confidence scores.

Output: clauses with type, confidence. Event clauses.classified.

Simplification & Translation Agent

Input: clauses.classified, user languages.

Action: Gemini simplifies each clause, produces translations (via Gemini or translate API). Store simplified_text + translations.

Output: clauses.enriched. (Also returns variants for overlay.)

Policy Retriever Agent (RAG)

Input: clauses.enriched.

Action: retrieve candidate policy snippets from BigQuery/Vector DB using embeddings, returning matches with version & effective dates.

Output: policy_matches per clause.

Date-Aware Verifier Agent

Input: policy_matches, user selected verification_date.

Action: select policy version valid on that date, compute semantic mapping (embedding similarity + rule heuristics), mark compliant/conflict/partial, provide matched policy lines and references.

Output: verification_result per clause + event verification.done.

Law Updater Agent

Scheduled agent that ingests official sources (gazettes, API feeds) and creates new policy versions in BigQuery with diffs. Emits policy.updated events.

Change-Notification Agent

Input: policy.updated.

Action: find docs referencing affected policy topics, compute impact score, push to users: toast / ticker / email. Provide "Verify as of" quick actions.

Output: notifications queued/pushed.

Authenticity Agent

Input: doc.understood + raw file.

Action: analyze metadata (creation/mod time), signature PKI check if present, stylometry for AI generation (LM detector), image forgery (Vision for pasted blocks), checksum validation.

Output: authenticity_score, evidence, auth.flag.

Compare & Traceability Agent

Input: user selects policies and docs to compare.

Action: create clause‚Üîpolicy mapping report, requirement-to-test mapping for standards.

Output: traceability report (exportable).

UniqueID Agent

Input: request from Ingest Agent at doc creation (region, type).

Action: allocate serial, return unique_id and QR payload (signed).

Output: unique id & QR.

Approval & Sharing Agent

Input: approval workflows initiated by user.

Action: manage multi-sign flows, OTP verification, PDF+QR generation, KMS sign.

Output: signed PDF, audit trail.

Analytics Agent

Global Chat Agent (Gemini)

Input: user chat; context fetched from Firestore/doc state/policy matches.

Action: answer questions, orchestrate other agents (e.g., "re-verify as of today") by sending commands to orchestrator.

Output: replies and orchestration triggers.

4 ‚Äî Data flows ‚Äî step by step (real user example)

User flow: Upload ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Share

User logs in (Firebase Auth) and uploads vendor_agreement.pdf. They select region = India, producer language = English, consumer language = Hindi, require translations: yes. They can optionally add extra policy references (e.g., GST, ISO 9001).

Ingest Agent stores file and emits doc.ready.

Document Understanding Agent uses Document AI ‚Üí produces clauses[] with offsets and detected signature area ‚Üí emits doc.understood.

Clause Classifier labels clauses; clauses.classified.

Simplification & Translation Agent simplifies clause text and produces Hindi translation ‚Üí updates clauses.enriched.

UniqueID Agent creates 091VA091-000123. This is stored in Document metadata. QR created.

Policy Retriever fetches policy snippets relevant to each clause (including GST rules, Contract Act, ISO sections) and returns candidate matches with version info.

User picks verification date: contract date (2025-09-21) or Today. Date-Aware Verifier chooses policy versions valid on that date and evaluates compliance. The UI shows red/green per clause accordingly.

If policy versions changed between contract date and today, Date-Aware Verifier can also compute "delta" and present suggestion: "Clause X was compliant at contract date but conflicts with current law effective 2025-09-22".

Authenticity Agent runs, gives authenticity_score 0.86 ‚Üí green. If low, UI shows red popup with evidence and option to request human review.

Change-Notification Agent will, when Law Updater later ingests new GST rules, find that this doc references GST topic and push a toast to the user: "New GST rule effective 2025-09-22 may affect Clause 4. Re-verify?" with buttons: See diff / Reverify now / Dismiss.

User clicks "Compare with ISO 9001": Compare Agent produces mapping of clauses to ISO requirements. User can click "AI confirm mapping" which triggers Global Chat Agent to produce an LLM-backed explanation and confirmation.

User initiates approval: Approval Agent sends OTP to approver phone, approver signs, final signed PDF generated and downloadable with QR. Audit trail appended.

All intermediate steps are tracked and visible in the UI as a step list with green/red state and time stamps. Every agent action is logged for audit & traceability.

5 ‚Äî UI / UX screens & behaviors (important interactions)

}

8 ‚Äî Unique ID generator rules & example

Format: <CCC><TYP><REG>-<SERIAL>

CCC = 3 digit country code (India 091), numeric standardized (or iso numeric).

TYP = 2 letter doc type (TA=Trade Agreement, VA=Vendor Agreement, SA=Service Agreement).

REG = 3 digit destination region code (Bangladesh 880 or state code).

SERIAL = 6-digit zero-padded counter per (CCC,TYP,REG).

Example: 091VA880-000123.

QR payload: {unique_id, doc_id, checksum, created_at, signature} signed by KMS.

9 ‚Äî Authenticity detection ‚Äî methods & limitations

Checks performed:

PDF metadata: creation vs modification timestamps, producer/creator fields.

Digital signature check: verify PKCS#7 / PAdES if present.

Image forensic: detect pasted blocks, inconsistent DPI, scanned signatures with copy/paste.

Stylometry & LLM detection: statistical detectors and a model trained to spot LLM artifacts; probabilistic, not definitive.

Cross-doc comparison: if same template exists, flag duplicates or mass reuse.

UI behavior:

Show authenticity_score + explicit evidence items.

Offer ‚ÄúRequest human review‚Äù button.

Never claim absolute proof; provide "probable" classification and explain limitations.

10 ‚Äî Law Updater & notifications (how to keep laws current)

Sources: official gazettes, ministry feeds, legal portals, publisher APIs.

Ingestion: Law Updater pulls sources on schedule + webhooks; applies parsers + normalizers; produces structured policy text with effective_from and version_id.

Diffing: compute diffs between versions (text differ) and store change metadata.

Impact detection: when a policy changes, find docs which have policy matches to same policy topics and compute an impact_score.

Notification: If impact > threshold, Change-Notification Agent: push toast/ticker & email + in-app modal. User can Reverify as of new effective date.

11 ‚Äî Rule: block removals that invalidate approvals

If user tries to remove a mandatory clause required by a standard/regulation (for example some regulatory disclosure), system must disallow it and show a legal warning modal.

This is enforced by the Compare & Traceability Agent + a simple rules engine that flags "must-have" clauses for a given policy bundle and region.

UI shows red modal: ‚ÄúCannot remove clause ‚Äî required by [policy X] effective [date]‚Äù with link to policy line.

12 ‚Äî Sharing & approval flows

Share: generate PDF summary + original file with embedded unique id and QR. Optionally encrypt or sign with KMS.

Approval: multi-step signature; recipients verify phone/email OTP, eSign via KMS or external eSign provider (DocuSign/SignEasy integration optional). Audit trail recorded.

Download: signed PDF available to authorized users; QR links to verification page (public or restricted per org policy).

13 ‚Äî Security, privacy & legal disclaimers

User consent on upload and notifications.

PII minimization; DLP scanning for sensitive info; redaction options.

Data residency per region (option to host policy DB in-country).

Audit logs immutable (append only) in BigQuery; compliance with GDPR/India rules where applicable.

Disclaimer: Not legal advice. Provide ‚ÄúRequest lawyer‚Äù paid escalation.
